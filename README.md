# SwiftUI Coordinators

SwiftUI Coordinators is a SwiftUI-based project that demonstrates the use of the Coordinator pattern to manage navigation and flow in a SwiftUI application. This project provides a structured way to handle view transitions and data flow between different parts of the application.

## Installation

To get started with SwiftUI Coordinators, clone the repository and open the project in Xcode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SwiftUICoordinators.git
cd SwiftUICoordinators
open SwiftUICoordinators.xcodeproj
```

Make sure you have Xcode installed on your machine.

## Usage

Once you have the project open in Xcode, you can run the application on a simulator or a physical device. The main entry point of the application is defined in `SwiftUICoordinatorsApp.swift`, which initializes the `ContentView`.

### Navigation

The application uses a Coordinator pattern to manage navigation. The `AppCoordinator` is responsible for managing the navigation stack and coordinating between different flow coordinators:

- **ABCFlowCoordinator**: Manages navigation for the ABC views.
- **C1C2C3FlowCoordinator**: Manages navigation for the C1, C2, and C3 views.
- **DEFFlowCoordinator**: Manages navigation for the DEF views.

Each view is created using a factory method defined in the respective view factory classes.

## Key Components

- **ContentView.swift**: The main view of the application that sets up the navigation stack.
- **AppCoordinator.swift**: The central coordinator that manages the navigation path and flow coordinators.
- **ViewFactory.swift**: A protocol that defines how views are created based on routes.
- **ABCViews.swift**: Contains views and flow coordinator for the ABC section of the app.
- **C1C2C3Views.swift**: Contains views and flow coordinator for the C1, C2, and C3 section of the app.
- **RouteCoordinators.swift**: Defines the protocols for the coordinator pattern.
